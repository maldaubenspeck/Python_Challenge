# Python_Challenge

For this challenge I really collaborated with my peers by organizing study groups for in person and zoom meeting. We were really able to help each other with errors we were getting and learning different ways to execute the same task. Watching the class zoom video helped me see how to push my files via Git. I was able to use AskBCS for this assignment when it came to importing my CSV file and the person named Robert was able to help me very easily and successfully. Also Chat GPT was extremely helpful in helping me determine the errors in my code and how make sure it would all run smoothly.
